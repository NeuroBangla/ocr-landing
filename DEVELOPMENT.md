⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT SELF-HOST THIS ON YOUR OWN CLUSTER ⚠️

Never, ever deploy this on a self-managed cluster. Doing so is dangerous and strongly discouraged.

This project depends on several unmaintained libraries, which may contain security vulnerabilities or incompatibilities that could compromise your environment. Hosting it yourself means taking on all the associated risks, including potential data loss, security breaches, and system instability.

For your safety and the stability of your systems, use a managed, isolated environment or avoid running it altogether unless you're absolutely sure of what you're doing.
